# Ham-Spam classification of SMS
The SMS Spam Collection is a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS Spam
research. It contains one set of SMS messages in English of 5,574 messages, tagged as either ham
(legitimate) or spam.
We have to train a model which may classify any given message as a ham or spam. This whole
dataset can be used for the training of the classifier.

## Dataset
The data set contains the messages and their labels (either spam or ham)

## Approach

1. Apply data wrangling, exploratory data analysis & inferential statistics on the data set.
2. For modeling use the bag of words approach, apply Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine Classification, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier, KNeighborsClassifier, Random Forest Classifier

## Used Packages

    1. Data Wrangling and Visualization: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
    2. Machine Learning: sklearn, NLTK for preprocessing
